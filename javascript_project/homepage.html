            IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files are a standardized, digital description of the built environment, including buildings and infrastructure. Developed by buildingSMART, IFC files are an open and neutral data format that aims to be interoperable, meaning it can be used by various software applications to collaborate and exchange data. The IFC model specification is vast, containing several hundreds of classes that cover a wide array of aspects related to construction and facility management. Some of these classes represent physical components like walls, doors, and windows (e.g., IfcWall, IfcDoor), while others represent spatial elements, materials, cost items, time schedules, and more. Each class has a set of attributes for storing properties relevant to that class. Relationships are used in the IFC schema to create connections between different entities. For example, a relationship can be used to represent that a door is inserted into a wall, or a wall is part of a building. By providing a common data model, IFC files facilitate information sharing and collaboration within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, making it a critical component of the Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach.
